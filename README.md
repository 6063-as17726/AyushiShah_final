This WIP file consists of the main logic and working of my final code. Currently, I have made all the logics work for character 1. I have a working version of my code for character 1. 
Before the final, I need to: 
1. Copy and paste the logic for character 2 and character 3 
2. Update the placeholder text and images. 
3. Update the key press with button press, and finalize the code to connect to serial when the characters are clicked. 
4. Make stylistic and visual decisions on the overall look of the program. 

Here are some reference images from office hours, for how I will extract the button click values and use it :
