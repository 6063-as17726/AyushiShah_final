6. Short discussion of why your project is relevant:  I read somewhere that women were not considered in medical related research till about 1993. Because of this, a lot of healthcare today is not mindful of the actual needs of women. Keeping this in mind, I wanted to create a space to tell stories of different women's journey with their health. It is important to me as it is related to my field of interest, Design for healthcare and wellness. 

7. Short discussion of feedback from user testing?: The user I tested with really liked the interactiveness, the content, and the idea of the project. But they felt that I could have added additional features in the execution. They suggested I allow the user to control the speed of the text, or allow them to fast forward through the stories. In response to that, I added a feature, where if the button is pressed for a third time, then the entire story appears at once.

9. Next steps 
For further development I could: 
• Add more characters 
• Add more interactions (example: switch to choose the character, etc.)
• Add more effect (example: sound effects, animations, etc.)
