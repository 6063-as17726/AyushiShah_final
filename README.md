6. Short discussion of why your project is relevant:  I read somewhere that women were not considered in medical related research till about 1993. Because of this, a lot of healthcare today is not mindful of the actual needs of women. Keeping this in mind, I wanted to create a space to tell stories of different women's journey with their health. 

7. Short discussion of feedback from user testing?: The user I tested with really liked the interactiveness, the content, and the idea of the project. But they felt that I could have added additional features in the execution. They suggested I allow the user to control the speed of the text, or allow them to fast forward through the stories.
